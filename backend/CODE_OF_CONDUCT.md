# VeggieShop Code of Conduct

> This Code of Conduct (“CoC”) sets expectations for everyone who participates in the VeggieShop project and community, including maintainers, contributors, users, sponsors, and vendors. We are committed to a respectful, safe, and inclusive environment.

---

## 1) Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack thereof), sexual identity and orientation, or technology choices.

---

## 2) Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment
- Showing empathy, kindness, and respect to all community members.
- Being open to constructive feedback; focusing on what is best for the project.
- Using welcoming, inclusive language; assuming good intent.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes.

### Examples of unacceptable behavior
- Harassment or abusive, derogatory, or demeaning comments.
- Trolling, personal or political attacks, and sustained disruption of discussions.
- Public or private harassment, including sexualized language or imagery.
- Publishing others’ private information (doxing) without explicit permission.
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

---

## 3) Scope

This CoC applies:
- Within all project spaces (repositories, issues, PRs, code reviews, discussions, chats).
- In public spaces when an individual is representing the project or community.
- To official events (virtual or in-person) and unofficial gatherings organized around the project.

---

## 4) Maintainers’ Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They may take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Maintainers must:
- Act with fairness and consistency.
- Explain enforcement decisions when appropriate.
- Recuse themselves from cases where they have a conflict of interest.

---

## 5) Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it as soon as possible.

**Primary channel (private email):** `conduct@veggieshop.example`  
**Security incidents (vulnerabilities, exploits):** `security@veggieshop.example`  
**Optional anonymous form (if configured):** `[INSERT FORM URL]`

When reporting, please include:
- Your contact information (optional).
- Names of the individuals involved (if known).
- When and where the incident occurred (links, screenshots, message IDs where possible).
- Context and a description of what happened.

Reports are handled confidentially. We will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** and follow up with next steps.

> If you feel in immediate danger or believe a crime has been committed, contact local authorities first.  
> If the report involves a maintainer, you may contact another maintainer or a sponsor organization directly.

---

## 6) Enforcement Process

We aim for a process that is **timely**, **consistent**, and **proportionate**:

1. **Acknowledge** – Confirm receipt of the report and name a point of contact.
2. **Assess** – Review evidence; request clarifications from involved parties; maintain confidentiality.
3. **Decide** – Determine whether the CoC was violated and the appropriate consequence.
4. **Notify** – Inform involved parties of the outcome and the right to request reconsideration.
5. **Follow-up** – Monitor for recurrence; document outcomes (privately); refine guidelines if necessary.

We may decline to act on clearly false, spam, or bad-faith reports.

---

## 7) Enforcement Guidelines (Consequences)

The community recognizes a spectrum of actions. The following guidelines describe common outcomes; maintainers may combine or adjust actions based on context and prior history.

1. **Correction**
  - *Impact:* Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional but minor.
  - *Consequence:* Private, written reminder of the CoC; request to modify behavior.

2. **Warning**
  - *Impact:* A single incident or pattern of behavior that violates the CoC.
  - *Consequence:* Formal warning; continued violations may result in escalating consequences.

3. **Temporary Restrictions**
  - *Impact:* Repeated violations after a warning, or more serious misconduct.
  - *Consequence:* Temporary ban from interactive spaces (issues/PRs/discussions) for a defined period; conditions for reinstatement provided.

4. **Permanent Ban**
  - *Impact:* Severe violations (e.g., harassment, doxing, threats) or persistent pattern after temporary restrictions.
  - *Consequence:* Permanent removal from all project spaces; where applicable, revocation of membership and access.

---

## 8) Moderation in Project Spaces

- Moderators may edit, lock, or remove comments, issues, or PRs that violate this CoC.
- Off-topic, spam, or low-effort content may be limited to keep discussions productive.
- Repeat misuse of project resources (e.g., abusive reviews, sabotaging CI) will trigger enforcement.

---

## 9) Privacy and Confidentiality

- Details shared in reports will be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible.
- We may disclose minimal information if necessary to investigate or comply with legal obligations.
- Report data will be retained only as long as necessary and handled securely.

---

## 10) Conflicts of Interest

Any maintainer who is the subject of a report or has a close personal/professional relationship with involved parties must recuse themselves from handling that report.

---

## 11) Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error or was disproportionate, you may request reconsideration by contacting `conduct@veggieshop.example` within **14 days** of the decision. Provide relevant context or evidence. Another maintainer (not involved in the original decision) will review.

---

## 12) Attribution

This Code of Conduct draws inspiration from widely adopted open-source policies and community guidelines. We acknowledge the value of the broader community’s work on inclusive conduct policies.

---

## 13) Updates

This CoC may be updated from time to time. Material changes will be announced in the repository (e.g., `CHANGELOG` or pinned discussion). The latest version in the `main` branch is the governing version.

---

## 14) Contact
